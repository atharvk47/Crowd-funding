# CrowdFunding

Decentralized crowdfunding offers individuals the opportunity to participate in fundraising campaigns while bypassing traditional intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and inclusivity. Users can directly support projects they believe in, fostering a democratic and borderless approach to fundraising, ultimately empowering creators and backers alike.

In this prototype, we have created two smart contracts in which we can execute a crowdfunding process wherein multiple people can contribute to fund and the owner can only withdraw the amount.

## Process

1. Open remix in any browser.

2. Import these contracts onto the platform.

3. Compile and deploy these contracts using CTRL+S and 'deploy' button.

## Note

1. This contract works on Sepolia Testnet only.
